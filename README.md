# Universe
Building a persistent universe for simulating a fictitious civilzation expanding from there home planet via AI.

I would like to build a universe full of stars and planets orbiting around and generating an AI who is capable of travelling between the stars to gather ressources to ulimatively stay alive as long as possible.

I am not a programmer so my code could be very ugly. 

Feel free to participate. 

Also I am always open for discussion.
